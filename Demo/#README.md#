# Demo for AbInitioVO and FastFloppyTail
 AbInitio Variable Order and FastFloppyTail Algorithms for Protein Structure Prediction from Sequence

## Contents
This directory contains versions of each script that can run on a single node and can produce structural predictions from 
AbInitioVO and structural ensembles from FastFloppyTail. Alpha-Synuclein is used as an example where re-weighted secondary 
structure prediction files have already been prepared.

## Run Commands
### AbInitioVO
```
run AbInitioVO.py -in asyn.fasta.txt -abinitiovo - abnstruct 5 -diso asyn.diso -t_frag asyn_dcor_frags.200.3mers -n_frag asyn_dcor_frags.200.9mers
```

### FastFloppyTail
```run FastFloppyTail.py -in asyn.fasta.txt -ftnstruct 500 -t_frag asyn_dcor_frags.200.3mers```
```run FloppyTail_Analysis.py D 1 140 ../asyn_STD.pdb Abasyn_*/```

The input structure mirrors that of _AbInitio_Analysis.py_ described above. After selecting the 1000 lowest energy structures, they can be further refined using the [FastRelax](https://www.rosettacommons.org/docs/latest/scripting_documentation/RosettaScripts/Movers/movers_pages/FastRelaxMover) algorithm and can be run via the command:

```run FloppyTail_Relax.py```

### Analysis
Within the _Analysis_Scripts_ directory there are a number of scripts that are capable of compuing a variety of parameters for comparison to experiments. The _README.md_ found inside that directory 
contains information about what is required and generated for each analysis.
