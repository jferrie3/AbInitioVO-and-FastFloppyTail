### FastFloppyTail
XXXXXX
## Installation Guide
__Operating System:__ Linux (64-bit)

__Programming Langauge:__ Python
This code was specifically written and tested in Python3.6 (python3.6.8)
	
__Required Python Packages:__
- PyRosetta
	- This was specifically written and tested with PyRosetta 2019.17+release.2cb3f3a py36_0. Additional information can be found on the [PyRosetta](http://www.pyrosetta.org/) website. This specific PyRosetta build can be downloaded [here](http://www.pyrosetta.org/dow) after obtaining a [license](https://els.comotion.uw.edu/express_license_technologies/pyrosetta)
- biopython (1.73)
- numpy (1.14.5)
- scipy (1.1.0)

__Anaconda Environment:__
An anaconda environment containing all necessary packages can be found in the anaconda folder. Build time for this Anaconda environment takes on the order of mintues to hours depending on the number of processors used and is largely dependent on the PyRosetta build time.

__Additional Reccommended Softwares:__
- Blast (blast-2.2.26)
- [DSSP](https://swift.cmbi.umcn.nl/gv/dssp/) (installed via [conda](https://anaconda.org/salilab/dssp)) 
- [Sparta+](https://spin.niddk.nih.gov/bax/software/SPARTA+/)
